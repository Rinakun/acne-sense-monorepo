If you don't see improvement after 2-3 months of consistently using over-the-counter treatments, it's a good idea to schedule a visit with a dermatologist.  They can offer more targeted treatment options and help prevent scarring.  A dermatologist is also recommended if your acne worsens significantly or causes you emotional distress.

You might experience some dryness, redness, or irritation – if this becomes severe, reduce the frequency of application.\n",
