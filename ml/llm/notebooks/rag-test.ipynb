      "You have both cystic acne and blackhead conditions. Cystic acne involves large, painful lesions that can lead to scarring, while blackheads are open comedones with a darkened oxidized sebum plug.\n",
      "\n",
      "RECOMMENDATIONS:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. For your cystic acne:\n",
      "   - Use oral antibiotics like doxycycline under a dermatologist's supervision.\n",
      "   - Consider intralesional steroid injections for relief from pain and inflammation.\n",
      "   - Isotretinoin might be recommended if other treatments fail, but it requires careful monitoring due to potential side effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. For blackheads:\n",
      "   - Opt for salicylic acid products at concentrations of 0.5-2% for gentle exfoliation and pore unclogging.\n",
      "   - Use clay masks or toners with charcoal to draw out impurities without causing dryness.\n",
      "   - Limit the use of thick, occlusive oils like mineral oil and avoid silicone-heavy products.\n",
      "\n",
      "SKINCARE TIPS:\n",
      "- For cystic acne: Focus on anti-inflammatory ingredients like niacinamide. Gentle hydrating products can help maintain skin's barrier function while minimizing irritation.\n",
      "- For blackheads: Incorporate daily exfoliation with a mild chemical or physical exfoliant to prevent pore congestion. Avoid abrasive treatments that could exacerbate your condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "IMPORTANT NOTES:\n",
      "- Monitor the timeline for improvement, which might take 8-12 weeks for cystic acne and 4-8 weeks for blackheads.\n",
      "- If you experience severe pain or scarring concerns, consult a dermatologist immediately.\n",
      "- Adjust skincare based on skin type: use lightweight hydration with oily skin while dry skin may benefit from barrier-repairing ingredients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combination Considerations:\n",
      "When dealing with both cystic acne and blackheads simultaneously, focus on treating the most severe condition first. Avoid combining treatments that could exacerbate inflammation or clog pores. Prioritize anti-inflammatory care for cystic acne and gentle exfoliation to manage blackheads. Consult a dermatologist if you're unsure about how to proceed with your skincare routine.\n",

      "Answer: No. While the Acne Sense app can provide initial guidance and recommendations based on your input about your acne condition, it is not capable of replacing professional medical evaluation by a dermatologist. Severe cases such as Acne Fulminans or when symptoms include signs like ulcerations, fever, weight loss require urgent medical care from a specialist. Additionally, persistent symptoms, especially those related to Excoriated Acne where anxiety or compulsive picking are factors, should be addressed with behavioral therapy and, if necessary, consultation of a dermatologist to ensure proper treatment and prevent further complications. Similarly, for Acne Mechanica triggered by physical occlusion or repetitive rubbing, the app can suggest preventive measures but professional advice is needed when lesions persist despite eliminating triggers. Lastly, Blackhead management involves consistent exfoliation which may lead to inflamed acne or scarring if not properly handled; thus, regular check-ups and guidance from a dermatologist are essential for optimal skin health and treatment outcomes.\n",

      "Custom Question: What are the best treatments for cystic acne for someone with sensitive skin?\n",
      "Answer: For a person with cystic acne who has sensitive skin, it's crucial to select gentle and soothing treatments. The main goal is to manage inflammation while avoiding irritants that could exacerbate sensitivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initial Treatment**: Oral isotretinoin might be considered under the supervision of a dermatologist due to its effectiveness in severe cases, but it should always be used cautiously because of potential side effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **OTC Ingredients**: The utility of over-the-counter treatments for cystic acne is limited; however, focusing on gentle cleansing products with no harsh ingredients can be beneficial.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Skincare Recommendations**:\n",
      "   - Use barrier-repair creams that help strengthen the skin's natural defenses without causing irritation.\n",
      "   - Opt for hypoallergenic products formulated specifically to prevent skin sensitivity reactions.\n",
      "   - Sterile wound care techniques are recommended, especially if the cystic acne leads to sinuses or breaks open.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Ingredients to Avoid**:\n",
      "   - Harsh exfoliants that might irritate sensitive skin should be avoided.\n",
      "   - Alcohol and fragrances can cause irritation; seek products that are free from these ingredients.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **When to Consult**: If draining sinuses occur with cystic acne, or if there is a systemic reaction such as fever, it's advisable to consult a dermatologist immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Expected Timeline**: Cystic acne under sensitive skin might require a management timeline of 6-12 months for controlled resolution, though results may vary depending on the severity and individual response.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Combination Considerations**: Avoid combining aggressive treatments that could potentially exacerbate sensitivity or cause further damage to the skin barrier. It's essential to monitor and adjust products based on how sensitive skin responds.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Skin Type Adjustments**:\n",
      "   - For sensitive skin, ingredients like oat extract can help in soothing irritation.\n",
      "   - Incorporating mild exfoliation can still be beneficial if done carefully; ensure that it doesn't overly dry or irritate the skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Age-Specific Considerations**: Young adults are commonly affected by cystic acne, so regular dermatological consultations might be helpful to monitor any changes and effectively manage symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, managing cystic acne with sensitive skin requires a delicate balance of treatment strategies that focus on reducing inflammation while avoiding potential irritants. Regular consultation with a dermatologist can provide personalized advice based on individual skin characteristics and the severity of acne.\n",
