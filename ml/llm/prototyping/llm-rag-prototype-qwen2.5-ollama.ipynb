      "Q: How does the Acne Sense app protect my privacy?\n",
      "A: Hello! I'm glad you're using Acne Sense to better understand your skin condition and find suitable treatment options. Based on our privacy guidelines, it's important to know that Acne Sense is designed with your privacy in mind. Facial analysis happens either directly on your device when possible or securely through encrypted cloud processing, ensuring that your images are not permanently stored after the analysis process.\n",
      "\n",
      "To help you track your progress and monitor improvements over time, use the 'Progress' feature within the app. Take new photos consistently, ideally every 2-4 weeks under similar lighting conditions and angles to see how your skin evolves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding your specific acne condition, Acne Sense analyzes different types of lesions such as papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts. The AI-powered assessment provides a personalized evaluation of your acne severity and suggests appropriate treatment options tailored to your skin's needs. This includes recommending suitable skincare routines that might help manage your condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're experiencing persistent or severe acne that doesn't improve with these recommendations, it's advisable to consult a professional dermatologist for further advice. They can provide personalized medical treatments based on your specific skin type and health history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, while Acne Sense offers valuable insights into your skin health, it should complement rather than replace professional medical guidance. If you have any concerns or questions about your acne treatment plan, don't hesitate to reach out to a healthcare provider for personalized advice.\n",
